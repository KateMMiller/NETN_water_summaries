SAGA,Blow-Me-Down Brook,NETN_SAGA_SB00,"Blow-Me-Down Brook is one of two perennial streams running through the park. This site, near the confluence with Blow-Me-Up Brook, was chosen because it samples the brook soon after crossing the parks northwestern boundary.

SAIR,Saugus River,NETN_SAIR_SA00,"The USGS has operated a continuous-record stream flow gage on the Saugus River just upstream of the park boundary (USGS 01102345) since 1994. Although the gaging station is just upstream of the park, because the stream reach within the park boundary is only 0.25 miles, this station adequately represents water quality within the park. Water quality samples and sonde measurements are taken twice a year (May and August) by NETN at the location of the USGS gage. Cumulative watershed area: 14,398.78 acres (58.27 km<sup>2</sup>)"
SAIR,Turning Basin,NETN_SAIR_SB00,"Historically, the tidal Turning Basin provided a shipping corridor for shallow draft boats bringing raw bog ore to the iron works and delivering finished goods to Boston and beyond. Water quality samples and sonde measurements are taken twice a year (May and August) at the Turning Basin. NETN water monitoring at SAIR began in 2007, and from that year through 2011 only sonde measurements are available for the Turning Basin. The Turning Basin was the subject of a major restoration project between the 2007 and 2008 sampling years. Cumulative watershed area: 14,472.50 acres (58.57 km<sup>2</sup>)"
SARA,Kroma Kill,NETN_SARA_SA00,"Kroma Kill is a third order stream in the park and is monitored upstream of the first bridge crossing along the Park Entrance Road from Route 4.

Cumulative watershed area: 4,295.62 acres (17.38 km<sup>2</sup>)"
SARA,Mill Creek Confluence,NETN_SARA_SD00,"Mill Creek enters the Hudson River as a second order stream. The Lower Mill Creek site is approximately 200 m downstream of the confluence of the North and South Forks (historic site SARA0053). This site provides an integrated sample for the watersheds of the North and South Forks as the South Fork can have low flow and does not meet sampling site criteria. The Lower Mill Creek site has a cobbled bed and a well-defined floodplain terrace similar to the North Fork. Cumulative watershed area: 1,865.88 acres (7.55 km<sup>2</sup>)"
SARA,Upper Mill Creek,NETN_SARA_SC00,"Mill Creek enters the Hudson River as a second order stream. The Upper Mill Creek site is located on the North Fork, near where the stream enters the park, just downstream of the park tour road. The stream is very small at this location but appears to be perennial and the box culvert can be used for accurate discharge measurements when flows are elevated. Cumulative watershed area: 576.19 acres (2.33 km<sup>2</sup>)"
WEFA,Weir Pond,NETN_WEFA_PA00,"Julian Alden Weir authorized workers to construct an earthen dam in 1896 to form the approximately four acre pond. The dam extends for over 200 feet along the northeast perimeter of the pond and varies in width from eight to ten feet. A roughly circular section of land in the northeast section of the pond was likely left unexcavated and when the pond filled with water, an island was formed. Weir erected a summerhouse (which disappeared entirely in the 1930s) on the center of this island. The pond has been used for artistic inspiration, recreational fishing, as a hiking destination, and as a source of ice until the 1940s. Max. depth 2.09 m (6.86 ft). Cumulative watershed area: 54.92 acres (0.22 km<sup>2</sup>)"
